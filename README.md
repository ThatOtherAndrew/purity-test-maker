# Purity Test Maker

If you've been on the internet for a decently high amount of time, you're probably familiar with the [Rice Purity Test](https://ricepuritytest.com/) - an infamous assessment of innocence and a possibly way too common topic of discussion in various social circles. Unsurprisingly, the simple design of the original Purity Test is also particularly attractive for parodies and similar imitation quizzes.

But how about a website which lets anybody easily create their own Purity Tests to share with friends? That's exactly what this Purity Test Maker is for!
